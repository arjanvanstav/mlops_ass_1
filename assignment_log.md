# step 1
-> The goal was to connect to snellius. The questions I had to answer were the following:<br />
	1. Create an account and an ssh to connect to snellius: ssh scur2377@snellius.surf.nl and i landend on node: int6<br />
	2. I provide the following screenshot of my login: ![](assets/sc_login_true.png)<br />
	3. The process of creating and logging in with my ssh went without errors, thanks to te help of the present TA's.<br />
		My SSH client and version are: OpenSSH_9.3p2, LibreSSL 3.3.6  (found with the command ssh -V)<br />
		I did have previous experience with logging in using SSH, even though this was during a course I took 2 years ago.<br /> 
		Avoiding errors came down to me thoroughly questioning the TA's and linstening to them, step by step.<br />
# step 2
